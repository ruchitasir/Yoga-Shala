# Node-Auth-Boiler
This is a boilerplate for an Express app with local user authentication. It exits so I have a customized boilerplate and don't have to start from scratch on all my projects.

## What It Includes

* Local Auth (email and passport)
* Passport and passport-local
* Sessions for saving user info and displaying flash messages
* Hashed passwords
* EJS templating and EJS layouts
* Sequelize User model
* Materialize styling- nav and footer
